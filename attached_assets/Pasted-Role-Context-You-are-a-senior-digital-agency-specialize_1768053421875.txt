Role & Context
You are a senior digital agency specialized in MedTech, Digital Health and Biotech branding.
Your task is to design a high-trust, high-tech, conversion-optimized website for an early-stage MedTech software platform.

Company Overview

Company Name: BioSignal Labs

Positioning:
BioSignal Labs develops a software platform for more precise and reliable medical data processing, with a strong focus on advanced signal processing (e.g. Kalman filtering), AI-assisted analysis, and workflow efficiency in medical and clinical research contexts.

Development Status:
Early-stage / in development.
Not yet a certified medical device.

Target Audience

Clinicians & Physicians (primary)

MedTech & Digital Health partners

Researchers & Academic Institutions

Investors (secondary)

The audience is highly educated, risk-aware, and trust-driven.

Core Goals of the Website

Generate qualified leads & demo requests

Communicate a credible investor and technology story

Explain a complex product in a clear, non-hype, medically responsible way

Establish trust, seriousness, and scientific rigor

Primary CTAs:

“Request a Demo”

“Contact Us”

Product Type

Software Platform
(Not hardware, not a consumer app)

Value Proposition (Hero Statement)

Clinical-grade signal intelligence for cleaner, more reliable biosignals.

(You may refine this wording slightly, but keep it professional and non-claiming.)

Key Differentiators (Must Be Reflected Visually & Textually)

Signal-first approach (data quality before AI predictions)

Advanced filtering & estimation methods (e.g. Kalman-based models)

Explainability & transparency over black-box AI

Workflow efficiency for clinicians and researchers

Privacy-aware, security-by-design architecture

Research- and pilot-oriented positioning (no medical outcome claims)

Visual & Brand Direction

Style:

High-tech futuristic

Warm human healthcare

Research lab aesthetic

Mood:

Clean, minimal, premium

Calm confidence (no hype, no buzzwords)

Apple-level polish, biotech seriousness

Color Direction:

Dark or neutral base (deep blue, charcoal, off-white)

Accents in cyan / teal / soft green

Avoid aggressive reds or playful colors

Typography:

Modern sans-serif

Scientific, readable, professional

Clear hierarchy, generous spacing

Motion & Visual Effects

Subtle, premium animations only

3D / WebGL-inspired visuals (e.g. abstract brain, neural structures, flowing signals)

Parallax or slow procedural motion backgrounds

No flashy or distracting effects

Animations must support credibility, not entertainment.

Required Pages & Structure
1. Home

Hero section with strong value proposition

Abstract medical/brain/signal visual background

Short explanation of what the platform does

Key differentiators (icons or minimal diagrams)

Trust signals (“Designed for clinical and research environments”)

CTA: Request a Demo

2. Solution / Technology

Explain the problem: noisy, fragmented, unreliable medical data

Explain the approach: signal processing + AI + efficiency

Visual diagrams or abstract flows (not marketing fluff)

Emphasis on data quality, robustness, and explainability

3. Product

Platform overview

Core modules or capabilities

Example use cases (diagnostics support, research, monitoring – carefully worded)

Screenshots or abstract UI placeholders

4. Clinical Evidence

Position as “in development / research stage”

No clinical claims

Focus on methodology, validation approach, and future roadmap

Language like “designed to support”, “aims to”, “research-focused”

5. Company

Mission-driven, science-first story

Early-stage, academic roots framed as strength

Vision for future impact in healthcare

Professional tone, not “startup hype”

6. Contact

Contact form

Email: martindiego@biotech.ch

Demo request CTA

Clean, minimal layout

Legal & Compliance

Include placeholders for:

Privacy Policy

Imprint / Legal Notice

Use safe, non-medical claims throughout

Avoid words like “diagnose”, “treat”, “improve outcomes”

Technical Requirements

SEO-friendly structure

Fast performance

Accessible (clear contrast, readable font sizes)

Mobile-responsive

Suitable for free hosting environments

Tone of Voice

Professional

Precise

Calm and confident

Scientific but accessible

No buzzwords, no exaggeration

Final Instruction:
Design the website as if it will be reviewed by clinicians, MedTech partners, and early-stage investors.
The site should feel like a credible research-grade platform, not a marketing experiment.
